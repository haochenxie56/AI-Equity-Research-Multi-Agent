# Phase 7B — Multi-window Relative Strength, Two-Ring Rotation Engine, and Market-Internals Fragility Layer

**Status**: Implemented + Codex fix round (×2) + polish rounds (×3) + rolling
internals round + rolling fix rounds (×2) (lib + tests green). Review-only; not
investment advice.
**Suite**: `scripts/test_reliability_phase_7b_rotation_internals.py` — **152/152**,
mock-only / offline.

**Data-vintage round 2 (RS stale guard + earnings universe filter).**
**Item 1 — RS path read a stale cache, silently.** Root cause: `cache_manager.load(tk,
"ohlcv")` globs `{tk}_ohlcv_*.parquet` sorted **descending**, so an old bare
`{tk}_ohlcv_20260515.parquet` (written by a Scanner/signal run that last executed
05-15) sorts **above** the fresh `{tk}_ohlcv_1y_1d_20260605.parquet` (`'2'>'1'`) —
RS read 05-15 with `data_source="live"` (no flag). Fix (preferred design —
**write-through**): `persist_frames_to_cache(tickers, load_ohlcv)` saves the
refresh's fresh frames under data_type `"ohlcv"` (cache HITs for already-fetched
candidates → no new network), which warms `cache_manager`'s in-memory cache (an
authoritative memory hit) and writes a today-dated file that sorts on top — so the
cache-only RS loader serves the refresh's vintage. The **RS loader still performs
zero fetches** (the 7A network-free contract holds; pinned by a test). Plus a
**guard** (d): each RS stamps `data_vintage` (frame's last date); a value lagging
the benchmark vintage sets **`rs_stale`** (distinct from a cache-MISS `rs_degraded`),
surfaced on cards + snapshot — a silent stale hit is now impossible.
**Item 2 — good_news_sold=39 was market-wide.** Root cause: the rolling refactor's
`_reaction_records` **dropped the universe filter** (round-3's `build_earnings_reactions`
had it), so it counted every company in the bulk calendar (and fetched ~266
tickers). Fix: `_reaction_records` filters to the universe; a **sanity bound**
degrades with reason `implausible_count` when evaluated > universe size. Corrected
today: evaluated **12**, good-news-sold **5** (was 92 / 39). **(e) Audit** — the only
remaining `cache_manager.load` consumer on the refresh path was the RS frame loader
(now write-through + guarded); fragility breadth/rolling were moved to `load_ohlcv`
last round; theme breadth uses `yfinance` directly (fresh); earnings reaction prices
use the Cockpit's `load_ohlcv` loader (fresh).

**Rolling fix round (banner field drift + data-vintage split).** Three bugs the
Cockpit exposed: (1) **Banner showed level + all-n/a.** Root cause:
`FragilityReading.to_dict()` **nests** components under `components`, but the
banner read flat top-level keys → every component `None` → `n/a`, while `level`
(top-level) survived. Fix: the Cockpit stores the **flat `fragility_snapshot(...)`**
in session_state — the SAME object written to `_meta` — and the banner reads
`fragility_level` + the flat component keys, so level and components come from ONE
source (structurally cannot disagree). (2) **Data-vintage split.** Root cause: the
fragility frame loader read the on-disk parquet cache (`cache_manager`, which
`load_ohlcv` does NOT write through, so it lagged to 2026-05-15) while the
benchmark used `load_ohlcv` (fresh) — so distribution (fresh) and breadth/rolling
(stale) described **different markets**, and the clock check (fresh frame) never
flagged it. Fix: the Cockpit uses **one loader (`load_ohlcv`) for benchmark AND
frames** (the same frames the refresh just loaded; in-memory fresh), and
`compute_market_fragility` enforces a **single vintage**: it records `data_vintage`
(the last trading date common to the frames used) and `vintage_mismatch` (benchmark
last ≠ universe last); on mismatch the rolling series **degrades to the snapshot
path** + flags, and the clock-drift check runs against the **common** vintage (so a
stale cache trips `clock_suspect`). (3) **Where `[high]` came from:** a *genuinely
computed* `reading.level` from the rolling replay over the vintage-split series —
not a stale session leftover nor a wrong key; the components were merely invisible
(bug 1). With the vintage guard a vintage-split escalation now degrades+flags rather
than silently reaching the UI. Also: the Macro Dashboard gains a **Market Internals
workbench** (10-day points trend + level markers + per-component table with value/
triggered/degrade-reason, vintage + hysteresis source); and the Cockpit's
last-refresh caption is filled via a placeholder AFTER the refresh runs (it used to
render above the button → showed "never" on the same run).

**Rolling internals round — two-track principle (audit vs signal).** Most
fragility inputs are pure functions of cached OHLCV, so they can be **recomputed
"as of" past trading days** at refresh time. This separates two trails:

* **Audit trail = the snapshot.** `_meta` records what the system *said* that day
  (today's reading), unchanged in meaning — plus the additive `hysteresis_source`
  and `rolling_window` fields.
* **Signal trail = the rolling recomputation.** `compute_rolling_raw_series`
  recomputes the raw level for each of the past `rolling_window_sessions` (default
  10) days from the *same* cached frames (zero new fetches), and
  `_replay_hysteresis` walks that contiguous series. Escalation therefore means
  **"the condition HELD N consecutive recomputed sessions"** (the originally
  intended meaning) — not "the system recorded it N times". Trading-day adjacency
  is inherent (the series is indexed by the benchmark calendar). `breadth_slope` is
  derived from this computed series, so it is **no longer null on day one**.
  Earnings: the single bulk Finnhub call's window widens to cover the lookback; a
  report is evaluated "as of day d" when its reaction session is on/before d within
  d's lookback. The reading carries `hysteresis_source = "rolling"`; when cache
  depth is insufficient (< escalate sessions / undated frames) it **falls back** to
  the snapshot-history path flagged `hysteresis_source = "snapshot"`. Performance:
  N × the existing per-day component cost over already-cached frames; **no new
  per-ticker network fetches** on the refresh path (pinned by a structural test).
  Out of scope: per-ticker RS-slope ranking signals (later phase); no change to
  regime, scoring weights, or status mapping beyond what hysteresis-source affects.

**Calibration tool:** `scripts/calibrate_fragility_backfill.py` (`--days N`,
`--fetch`) writes a per-day component/points/raw/effective table (markdown + CSV)
to `docs/calibration/`, marks level transitions, and prints a summary — with an
explicit hindsight caveat in the output. It is a TOOL (may fetch; not subject to
the network-free contract); the user annotates days against remembered market feel
and tunes `INTERNALS_CONFIG`. This is the macro layer's first feedback loop.

**Polish round 3 (snapshot _meta + Codex):** (1) **Banner zero/null** — the
fragility line distinguishes three states per component: a numeric value
**including 0** renders the number, `None`/degraded renders an explicit `n/a`
marker, and a component is **never silently omitted** (fixes `if _gns:` dropping
`good_news_sold=0` and a `_b20p or _b20` falsy-zero bug). (2) **Earnings reactions
were never evaluated** — root cause: the Cockpit's `compute_market_fragility` call
never passed an earnings source, so component (a) always degraded
(`earnings_evaluated=0`). Now a **single bulk Finnhub earnings-calendar call**
(`signal_engine.fetch_earnings_reactions_calendar`, skippable/degradable) feeds
`build_earnings_reactions`, which reads the next-session reaction from the **same
cached OHLCV** (no per-ticker network); the degrade reason is recorded distinctly
(`finnhub_unavailable` vs `no_reports_in_window` vs `earnings_source_absent`) on
the reading + snapshot `_meta`. (3) **Volume monitor watched the wrong themes** —
it selected leading/rotating_in only, excluding a just-distributing ex-leader
(`rotating_out`, the ai_chips/AVGO case — the prime subject). Selection is now
**leading ∪ rotating_out, ranked by momentum, capped at N=3**; `rotating_in` (new
entrant, no distribution history) and `out_of_favor` (already gone) are excluded.
The `leading_theme_volume_shrinking` field/keys are unchanged (snapshot
backward-compatible; "leading" now means current+recent leaders).

**Polish round 2 (Cockpit real-data verification — 3 display/integration bugs):**
(1) **Fragility banner was invisible at level=normal** — Section A gated the line
on `level != "normal"`, so a healthy market hid the monitor entirely. Root cause:
the render guard, not a data/session-key problem (compute_market_fragility runs and
stores `cockpit_fragility` correctly). Now the line ALWAYS renders after a refresh
(incl. `normal`), showing the level + component values; a render-smoke presence
assertion pins it. (2) **LONG why_now showed the 5D RS line** — root cause: the
ranker populated `why_now_by_horizon[hz]` *after* `if lv is None: continue`, so when
the entry engine returned no LONG levels that horizon was never written and the UI
fell back to the dominant (SHORT/5D) list. The macro lens never touched
`build_reason_codes` (red herring). Now per-horizon why_now is built for ALL
horizons regardless of `lv`, and the UI no longer cross-falls-back once the map
exists; a structural invariant pins that the RS window derives only from the
`horizon` arg. (3) **Theme card "3M return" was the ABSOLUTE figure** while ranking
uses excess vs QQQ — the headline in Cockpit Section B now shows `excess_3m`
labeled "3月超额 (vs QQQ)" / "3M excess (vs QQQ)", and the Sector theme table gains
a dedicated excess-vs-QQQ column beside the absolute returns.

**Polish round 1 (post-7B):** (1) `is_adjacent_session` now returns `False` for
`d1 == d2`, so a same-session duplicate snapshot can't extend a hysteresis chain.
(2) The **leading-theme volume-shrink** flag (judgment call 5) is now implemented:
`leading_theme_volume_shrink` aggregates constituent **dollar volume** (Close×Volume)
for the top-2 leading themes — recent 10d avg vs prior 25d baseline, from the same
cached OHLCV (no new fetch) — and fires when the ratio < `leading_theme_vol_shrink_ratio`
(0.85); below `leading_theme_min_constituents` (5) usable constituents it stays
degraded. **Leading-theme breadth-narrowing remains scaffolded** (needs per-theme
historical internal breadth the snapshot doesn't yet persist) → stays `False`,
listed in `degraded`. (3) The AST registry-completeness guard now also catches
`missing += [...]` and `missing.extend([...])`. (4) **WSL clock-drift defense**:
`detect_clock_drift` compares the system date to the latest cached benchmark trading
date — earlier than it, or > `clock_drift_max_ahead_days` (7) ahead — and sets
`clock_suspect` in the snapshot `_meta` + a Cockpit banner warning, but **never
blocks the write**. Canonical regressions all green (7A 115, stopbleed 64,
6c_b 47, equity_render_order 50, 6c_trading_desk 118, 6c_v3_entry_v4 47,
6b_v3_horizon_scoring 189, theme_baskets 146, scanner_rotation_adapter 15).

All computation is **deterministic; no LLM anywhere in this phase**. Every window
and threshold lives in a visible config block for later calibration.

This phase makes **rotation VISIBLE** and **market deterioration EARLY-VISIBLE**.
It addresses three real observations:

1. All three horizon views showed the same 1-month RS — short-horizon grades were
   not backed by short-horizon evidence.
2. Single-window absolute theme momentum cannot see rotation (rotation *is* the
   divergence between windows) and keeps ranking yesterday's winners on crash days.
3. The regime classifier reads priced-in stress (VIX, spreads) and only flips
   *after* a drawdown, while market internals (strong earnings sold, shrinking
   volume in leading themes, narrowing breadth) deteriorate for days beforehand.

## Task 1 — Multi-window Relative Strength (`lib/relative_strength.py`)

### Window config

```python
RS_WINDOWS = {"5d": 5, "10d": 10, "1m": 21, "3m": 63, "6m": 126, "12m": 252}  # trading days
HORIZON_RS_WINDOWS = {
    "short": ("5d", "10d"),   # primary, secondary
    "mid":   ("1m", "3m"),
    "long":  ("6m", "12m"),
}
_BENCH_PERIOD = "2y"   # benchmarks are the single per-refresh fetch → always 12M-capable
```

* Excess returns vs **SPY and QQQ** are computed over every window. Flat fields
  (`ret_<win>`, `ret_<win>_vs_spy`, `ret_<win>_vs_qqq`) plus a full `windows`
  snapshot dict (`{win: {ret, vs_spy, vs_qqq}}`) are stored per ticker — the raw
  material for future RS-slope signals.
* **Horizon consumption**: each horizon's weight table consumes its **own**
  composite — `rs_short` (5D/10D), `rs_mid` (1M/3M), `rs_long` (6M/12M). The
  `RelativeStrength.composite_for(horizon)` helper returns the horizon composite,
  falling back to the legacy `rs_composite` when 7B did not compute one (so pre-7B
  RS objects and the 7A suite score **byte-identically**).
* **LONG RS is trend confirmation, not chase-the-winner.** The overextension
  blocker already guards the chase side; the LONG composite simply confirms the
  6M/12M trend is intact.
* **Data sufficiency / degrade**: cached history is ~1y. When **12M cannot be
  computed** the reading degrades to **6M** and sets `rs_window_degraded=True`.
  Cache-only discipline and the 7A `rs_degraded` behavior are unchanged.
* **Display**: the `why_now` RS line follows the **selected horizon** — SHORT
  shows `5日相对QQQ +x%`, MID `近1月…`, LONG `近6月…`. `build_reason_codes(...,
  horizon=…)` selects the window; the ranker stores `why_now_by_horizon` for
  enriched cards so the Cockpit selector renders the matching line.
* **Backward compat**: `compute_rs_composite` and all legacy flat fields are
  unchanged; consumers (scoring, snapshot, reason codes) were updated in one pass
  with systematic field naming.
* **Date-aligned excess** (fix round): `benchmark_frames` keeps the dated
  benchmark Close Series; `compute_relative_strength(..., bench_closes=)`
  inner-joins ticker∩benchmark on **dates** before windowing, so a halted/missing
  ticker session never compares N ticker bars vs N benchmark bars ending on
  different effective dates. Sufficiency runs on the **aligned** length (degrades
  honestly: 12M→6M / `rs_window_degraded`). The positional path (no dates / fixture
  frames) is unchanged → 7A byte-compat preserved.

---

## Task 2 — Two-Ring Rotation Engine

### Outer ring — GICS sector layer (`lib/rotation.py`)

* Multi-window **relative returns vs SPY** over `OD_WINDOW_DAYS`
  (`5d/10d/1m/3m/6m/12m`) via `build_sector_excess(ohlcv_loader=…)` (injectable —
  the network-free path passes a cache-only loader). The existing `score`
  contract in `compute_sector_scores` is **unchanged** (no numeric-contract break).
* **Offense / Defense reading** (`offense_defense_reading(sector_excess)`), a pure
  function consumed by both the Sector page and the fragility layer:

  | Basket | Sectors |
  |--------|---------|
  | OFFENSE | Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Semiconductors |
  | DEFENSE | Utilities, Consumer Staples, Health Care |

  Output: `direction` (offense / defense / balanced), `magnitude`
  (strong ≥ 5pp / moderate ≥ 2pp / mild), `avg_diff` (mean offense−defense pp),
  `by_window` breakdown, and `confirming_windows` (windows confirming the
  direction beyond `OD_CONFIRM_THRESHOLD_PP = 1.0`). `|avg_diff| ≤
  OD_BALANCED_PP (1.0)` → balanced. **This reading is also input (e) to Task 3.**

### Inner ring — AI theme layer (`lib/theme_baskets.py`)

* `compute_theme_momentum` now computes **EXCESS return vs benchmark** (config
  `THEME_BENCHMARK_DEFAULT = "QQQ"`, per-theme overridable via a `benchmark` key)
  over the multi-window set, replacing the single fixed window. `compute_all_themes`
  fetches each benchmark **once** and ranks `momentum_score` by the **EXCESS-3M**
  percentile.

* **Divergence matrix** — 5D vs 1M excess quadrants → deterministic stage label.
  "strong" = excess **strictly greater** than the threshold; the boundary value
  itself is on the weak side.

  ```python
  DIVERGENCE_THRESHOLDS = {"excess_5d_pp": 0.0, "excess_1m_pp": 0.0}
  ```

  | 5D excess | 1M excess | stage |
  |-----------|-----------|-------|
  | strong | strong | `leading` |
  | strong | flat/weak | `rotating_in` |
  | weak | strong | `rotating_out` |
  | weak | weak | `out_of_favor` |

* **Group-confirmation breadth** per theme: `% of constituents beating the
  benchmark over the active window` + `% above SMA20`. A stage is **confirmed**
  only when breadth passes `BREADTH_CONFIRM_FRACTION = 0.50` (direction-aware: a
  bullish stage needs broad participation `beat ≥ 0.5`; a bearish stage needs
  broad weakness `beat ≤ 0.5`). Otherwise the label carries **unconfirmed** — the
  single-stock event guard.

* **Macro lens** (display/default-window only — never re-ranks):

  ```python
  MACRO_LENS_WINDOW = {"risk_off": "5d", "transition": "5d", "risk_on": "1m", ...}
  ```

  `risk_off`/`transition` default to the 5D divergence + downside-resilience lens;
  `risk_on` to the 1M trend. Theme scores themselves are not regime-adjusted.

* Stage label + breadth land on `OpportunityCard.theme_stage` /
  `theme_stage_confirmed`, on the daily snapshot, and (via the ranker's
  excess-based `momentum_score`) on the theme-momentum scoring component.

---

## Task 3 — Market-Internals Fragility Layer (`lib/market_internals.py`)

Answers **"where are we HEADING"** while the regime layer keeps answering "where
are we CONFIRMED to be". **`lib/macro_regime.py` is FROZEN** — this module never
imports, calls, mutates, or overrides it.

### Components (each deterministic, each from cached/free data, each attributable)

| # | Component | Definition |
|---|-----------|------------|
| a | Earnings reaction quality | `count_good_news_sold` — a **beat** whose next-session return ≤ `good_news_sold_reaction_pp (0.0)` is "good news sold" (the AVGO pattern). Skipped silently where data is unavailable. |
| b | Breadth trend | `% of universe above SMA20/SMA50` (level) + slope vs a prior reading; `breadth_weak_pct = 0.40`, `breadth_slope_drop = 0.08`. Leading-theme internal-breadth narrowing flag. |
| c | Volume character | IBD-style **distribution-day** count on SPY/QQQ (down ≥ `0.2%` on higher volume than the prior session, rolling 25 sessions) + leading-theme shrinking-volume flag. |
| d | Rally quality | After a down day ≤ `rally_down_day_pct (-1%)`, was the bounce on **shrinking volume** (< `0.90×` the down-day volume) → weak-bounce flag. |
| e | Offense/defense | The Task 2 outer-ring reading (defensive lean adds points). |

### Composite + hysteresis

Points: distribution-days-high `+2` / -elevated `+1`; good-news-sold-high `+2` /
-elevated `+1`; breadth-weak `+1`; breadth-narrowing `+1`; leading-theme breadth
narrowing `+1`; leading-theme volume shrinking `+1`; weak-bounce `+1`; defensive
offense/defense strong `+2` / else `+1`. Raw level: `≥ high_points (4)` → **high**,
`≥ elevated_points (2)` → **elevated**, else **normal**.

**Hysteresis** (the snapshot history is the memory):
`hysteresis_escalate_sessions = 2`, `hysteresis_deescalate_sessions = 1`,
`hysteresis_max_calendar_gap_days = 4` (fallback only). Escalation to a higher
*effective* level requires the raw level to hold at/above it for **N consecutive
TRADING sessions including today** — a **single-day spike never escalates**.
Adjacency is decided by the **benchmark (SPY→QQQ) trading-date index** — the
cached OHLCV index *is* the trading calendar (no new dependency, no network):
`is_adjacent_session(d1, d2, index)` is true iff **no benchmark trading date lies
strictly between** the two snapshot dates (so Fri→Mon is adjacent, a holiday Monday
makes Fri→Tue adjacent, and Fri→Wed with Mon/Tue trading is a break). A break
restarts the count, so a gap can only **delay** escalation, never fabricate it.
When the index can't cover the dates (cache miss/stale) it **falls back** to the
`hysteresis_max_calendar_gap_days` bound and sets `adjacency_degraded` (never
silently assumes adjacency). De-escalation is **faster** (1 session below) and
gap-irrelevant. Prior level, recent raw levels, AND their dates come from the
daily snapshot `_meta` via `history_from_snapshots`.

### Effects — STRICT tighten-only contract

* Fragility **NEVER** changes the regime label, never flips `risk_on→off`, never
  relaxes any gate. Test invariant: with fragility forced **high**, the
  `MacroRegimeResult` object is **byte-identical** (`==`).
* `elevated`/`high` tighten **SHORT-horizon** status gating: an in-zone SHORT
  candidate degrades from *Actionable Now* to a wait state with reason code
  `internals_deteriorating` — mirroring the calendar gate in `derive_status`.
  Config: `GATE_BY_LEVEL = {"high": ("short",), "elevated": (), "normal": ()}` —
  **default: high gates SHORT, elevated only annotates.**
* Cockpit banner: alongside the regime line, fragility level + top triggered
  components with numbers (e.g. *"regime risk_on, but internals: distribution
  days 4/25, breadth 58%→41%, 2 good-news-sold"*). Bilingual. Sector page gets the
  full component table.
* `thesis_monitor`: fragility is a **WATCH-level annotation** on signal D
  (`fragility_note` / `fragility_watch`) — high fragility notes the holding but
  **never escalates `thesis_status`** by itself. The monitor's existing semantics
  (the test-pinned `compute_thesis_status`) are untouched.
* **Snapshot** (mandatory — fragility's lead/false-positive rate is judged from
  history later): daily level + raw level + points + triggered flags + **every
  component value** via `fragility_snapshot`.

### Performance & data constraints

* The ranking/refresh path stays **network-free** (7A contract): internals and
  breadth come from the signal pipeline's cached OHLCV (cache-only loaders, degrade
  flags on misses); benchmarks are the single fetch; the Finnhub earnings calendar
  is at most one bulk call per refresh, skippable/degradable.
* **Frozen**: `lib/macro_regime.py`, `lib/workflow_state.py`, `lib/technical.py`,
  `.claude/agents/*`. No paid APIs. Review-only outputs.

---

## Judgment calls

1. **`rs_composite` kept byte-identical.** Rather than rebasing the legacy
   composite onto the new windows (which would have moved every 7A score), the
   legacy 5D+1M roll-up is frozen and three **new** per-horizon composites were
   added. Pre-7B RS objects fall back to `rs_composite`, so the 7A suite is
   unaffected; the ranker consumes the per-horizon composite when present.
2. **Sector `score` contract preserved.** `compute_sector_scores` was *not*
   rewritten to multi-window relative returns (that would break Sector-page
   consumers); the multi-window machinery lives in `build_sector_excess` +
   `offense_defense_reading`, which the offense/defense panel and fragility layer
   consume. This satisfies "keep the existing score consumers working."
3. **Theme breadth fetches constituents.** Breadth is inherently constituent-level,
   so `compute_all_themes` reads constituent histories (cached 30 min) — analogous
   to the single per-refresh theme fetch, not part of the per-ticker network-free
   ranking loop (the ranker receives precomputed `themes`). The network-free
   fragility path uses its own cache-only loaders.
4. **Fragility gate → `Research Required`.** To mirror the calendar gate exactly,
   the SHORT in-zone degrade lands on `Research Required` (a wait state) with the
   `internals_deteriorating` reason, rather than introducing a new status value.
5. **Thesis fragility is annotation-only.** To keep `compute_thesis_status`
   byte-identical (it is test-pinned), fragility adds a note/flag and does not feed
   the four-flag tally at all — strictly within "never escalates beyond watch".

---

## Codex fix round (2 should-fix, both correctness)

1. **Hysteresis adjacency via the benchmark trading calendar** (revised).
   `history_from_snapshots` previously discarded dates, so snapshots from
   2026-06-01 and 2026-06-04 fabricated "2 consecutive" readings across missed
   days. The adjacency source is now the **benchmark (SPY→QQQ) trading-date
   index** — NOT a calendar-day heuristic and NOT a new dependency:
   `is_adjacent_session(d1, d2, benchmark_index)` is true iff no benchmark trading
   date lies strictly between the two dates. `apply_hysteresis(recent_dates=,
   today_date=, benchmark_index=)` breaks the chain (and restarts counting) on a
   non-adjacent pair → a gap can only **delay** escalation, never fabricate it;
   de-escalation stays immediate. When the index can't cover the dates it falls
   back to the `hysteresis_max_calendar_gap_days = 4` bound and flags
   `adjacency_degraded` on the reading (+ `hysteresis_adjacency` in `degraded`,
   `fragility_adjacency_degraded` in the snapshot). `compute_market_fragility`
   feeds the cached SPY (fallback QQQ) date index. Tests: Fri+Mon (weekend, no
   trading day between) consecutive; Fri+Wed with Mon/Tue between → break, no
   escalation; market-holiday Monday → Fri+Tue still consecutive; fallback path
   flags `adjacency_degraded`; pandas DatetimeIndex parity; config visible.
2. **RS excess needs date-aligned series.** Window returns were computed from
   independent positional close lists for ticker and benchmark, then subtracted —
   no date-index alignment, so a halted ticker session compared mismatched dates.
   `compute_relative_strength(..., bench_closes=)` now inner-joins on the common
   date index before windowing (`_aligned_window_returns`); sufficiency runs on the
   aligned length; the legacy positional/fixture path (and `rs_composite`) is
   untouched (7A byte-compat). Tests: a fixture with deliberately missing ticker
   dates → excess equals the hand-computed aligned value, not the positional-slice
   value; QQQ gaps align independently.

## Data-vintage round 3 — earnings degrade visibility + banner↔_meta parity

### Earnings degrade is honest, and now self-explanatory on screen

The good-news-sold component is computed over the **candidate universe** (the
round-2 fix that stopped the market-wide `good_news_sold=39/92` leak by filtering
`_reaction_records` to `universe` and bounding `earnings_evaluated <= |universe|`).
A consequence, surfaced by the 2026-06-06 00:01 live refresh: when the day's
universe is 20 momentum names that all reported 10–88 days ago, **zero** fall in
the `earnings_lookback_sessions = 5` window, so the component correctly degrades to
`no_reports_in_window` (`good_news_sold=null`, `earnings_evaluated=0`). This is the
right reading for that universe — not a bug. The earlier inline "lit" reading
(evaluated=12) came from a market-wide reconstruction the universe filter is
designed to exclude; it was the verification that was wrong, not the live path.

- **Banner now says WHY.** When `good_news_sold` is `None`, the Cockpit banner
  renders `<n/a> (earnings_degrade_reason)` — e.g. `好消息被卖: 无数据
  (no_reports_in_window)` — using the same `earnings_degrade_reason` carried in the
  `_meta`. The Macro Dashboard internals table already shows the reason in its
  "degrade reason" column. A report/UI divergence is therefore self-explanatory on
  both surfaces.
- **Rate-limit defense.** `fetch_earnings_reactions_calendar` (the single bulk
  Finnhub call) now **retries once with a short backoff** (`_FINNHUB_BULK_RETRY_BACKOFF_S`,
  monkeypatchable to 0 in tests) before declaring `finnhub_unavailable`. The free
  tier is 60 req/min and a refresh that already fetched the candidate universe can
  trip a 429, which `_finnhub_get` swallows to `None`. Still fully degradable: both
  attempts failing → raises → caller records `finnhub_unavailable` (never blocks).
- **After-midnight / weekend anchoring is safe.** `today_str` is the system date
  (Saturday 06-06), but the earnings window counts **benchmark trading sessions**
  (`rxn < bd <= today`), and `bench_dates` ends on the last traded session
  (Fri 06-05). A weekend `today_str` therefore cannot empty an otherwise-populated
  window; the degrade above is purely the universe-recency effect, not anchoring.

### Breadth-slope trigger boundary (by design)

`breadth_narrowing` fires when `comp.breadth_slope <= -abs(breadth_slope_drop)`
with `breadth_slope_drop = 0.08`. The boundary is **inclusive on the magnitude**:
a drop of *exactly* 0.08 (e.g. 68% → 60%) **does** fire (it is `<=`, i.e. "fell by
at least 8 pp"), it is **not** strictly-greater. The 06-06 reading
(68.42% → 60.00%, slope `-0.0842`) clears the threshold and triggers.

### Banner↔_meta parity test (§18) — the real-path guarantee

Root cause of three straight report/UI mismatches: verification reconstructed the
computation inline instead of driving the real refresh, so call-site differences
never surfaced until the next live refresh. §18 of the 7B suite drives the **actual
`_run_refresh`** (the function the refresh button triggers) under AppTest with only
the network leaves mocked — the real `compute_market_fragility`,
`fragility_snapshot`, and `write_daily_snapshot` run — then asserts every component
token the banner renders equals the `_meta` that same refresh wrote (lit path: a
counted number; dark path: `n/a (no_reports_in_window)`). Two negative checks prove
the test FAILS when banner and `_meta` diverge (mutated level; mutated component
value). The three historical mismatches (nested components, vintage split, dead
earnings arg) each render a banner that disagrees with `_meta` → each would fail
this check. The live-path verification rule is recorded in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Round 4 — good-news-sold scoped to the SCAN universe (market signal)

### Decision

good-news-sold is a **market-internals** signal (are beats getting sold across the
tape?), so its universe is the broad **scan** universe — the same set the candidate
generator scanned this refresh (`SP500_TOP_100` + selected theme constituents +
hand-offs, ~100–150 tickers) — NOT the ranked top-N. Scoping it to the top-20
momentum candidates was a **call-site artifact**: those names rarely have a fresh
print, so the component read `no_reports_in_window` almost every day (the round-3
diagnosis: closest report 10 days out among 20 names). The original motivating case
(a strong report SOLD, e.g. AVGO) lives in the broad scan set, not necessarily in
the day's top candidates.

### Implementation (network-free, explicit scope)

- **Scope is published, not re-derived.** `generate_candidates` publishes the exact
  universe it scanned to `st.session_state["cockpit_scan_universe"]`
  (`_publish_scan_universe`); the Cockpit passes that object as
  `compute_market_fragility(earnings_universe=…)`. Passing the generator's own
  object (not a freshly rebuilt list) prevents drift between the scanned set and the
  earnings scope. Breadth keeps using the ranked `universe` (unchanged).
- **Cache-only earnings loader.** The scan fetched 1y OHLCV only for Layer-1
  survivors, so the earnings loader is `earnings_frame_loader =
  cache_manager.load(tk, "ohlcv_1y_1d")` — a cache-resident read that returns `None`
  on a miss and NEVER triggers a network fetch. (`get_ohlcv` persists every fetched
  1y frame under that key, so survivors are cache-resident in-process.)
- **Skipped + partial coverage.** A report-ticker in the scan universe + lookback
  window whose frame is not cache-resident is **skipped and counted**
  (`earnings_skipped`, `_count_frameless_in_window`). The degrade-reason vocabulary
  gains **`partial_frame_coverage`**, used when `skipped > evaluated` — distinct from
  `no_reports_in_window` (which means there were no in-window scan-universe reports
  at all). `partial_frame_coverage` can co-exist with a reported number (evaluated >
  0 but skipped still exceeded it); the banner appends the reason in that case
  (`good-news-sold: 2 (partial_frame_coverage)`), and the Macro Dashboard table
  shows the reason + `skipped=N`.
- **Implausibility bound rescoped.** `earnings_evaluated > |scan universe|` →
  `implausible_count` (the 39/92 leak backstop now checks the scan-universe size).
- **Rolling as-of replay uses the same scope.** The single `_reaction_records` call
  (scan-universe-filtered, cache-only loader) feeds both the live count and the
  rolling raw series, so live and as-of counts are consistent by construction.
- **Backward compatible.** `earnings_universe` / `earnings_frame_loader` default to
  `universe` / `frame_loader`, so existing callers/tests keep the breadth-universe
  scope with no skips.

### Tests

§17c pins the rescope deterministically (non-top-N evaluated; frameless →
`partial_frame_coverage`; empty → `no_reports_in_window`; implausible bound on scan
size; backward-compat; publish normalization). §18 extends the end-to-end parity
harness: the mocked `generate_candidates` PUBLISHES the scan universe via the real
`_publish_scan_universe`, the earnings loader is a mocked `cache_manager.load`, and a
SCAN ticker that is **not** in the top-N (`SCANX`) is evaluated on the live banner +
`_meta`; a separate scenario drives `partial_frame_coverage`. This is exactly the
call-site class of bug the parity test exists to catch.

### Live verification (real `_run_refresh`, 2026-06-06)

Driven via `pages/7_Investment_Cockpit.py::_run_refresh` under AppTest (clicking the
`cockpit_refresh_all` button) against LIVE network, snapshot dir redirected to a temp
path (non-destructive):

- **Scope works.** Over a **100-ticker** scan universe the refresh evaluated
  **4** reports → **good_news_sold = 1**, `earnings_skipped = 0`,
  `earnings_degrade_reason = ""`, banner `good-news-sold: 1`, raw/effective level
  `elevated`. An isolated probe of the bulk calendar returned 270 market reports,
  **13 in the scan universe** (AVGO, NVDA, CRM, PANW, COST, INTU, …) — the
  broad-market names the old top-20 scope structurally missed. (Effective level read
  `elevated` here only because the temp snapshot dir carried no hysteresis history;
  the earnings reading is the focus and is unaffected.)
- **Cold-cache caveat (operational).** On the FIRST refresh of a cold cache the bulk
  earnings-calendar call competes with the scan's ~450 per-ticker Finnhub calls
  (Track B insider/news/analyst × universe) and is rate-limited → `finnhub_unavailable`
  even with the round-3 single retry. The endpoint itself is healthy (the isolated
  probe succeeds), and the SECOND refresh — Track B now cached in-process, rate
  window reset — gets the calendar call through. Follow-up (not this round): issue
  the single bulk calendar call BEFORE the Track B fan-out, or widen the backoff, so
  a cold-cache refresh evaluates earnings on the first pass.
